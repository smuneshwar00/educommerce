We are replicating a online commerce site thats built with tailwind css.

1. Copied some tailwindcss code in header component template.
2. Installed Tailwind to support it with following commands:
    npx tailwindcss init -> creates tailwind config and installs tailwind.
    npm install tailwindcss -> in case npx command fails to update this dependency.
